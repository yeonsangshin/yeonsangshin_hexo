Hello !

My name is Yeonsang Shin (신연상).

I'm an undergraduate student at [Seoul National University, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en), a research intern at [KRAFTON](https://www.krafton.ai/en/) until Dec 2024.

My research journey in Computer Vision has evolved from working with unconventional visual representations (SVG, Layouts) to 3D Computer Vision. Now, I"m interested in Computational Imaging, including Computer Graphics, AR/VR, and cameras.
