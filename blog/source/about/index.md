Hello !

My name is Yeonsang Shin (신연상).

I'm an undergraduate student at [Seoul National University, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://ece.snu.ac.kr/en), a research intern at [Visual Computing Lab, KAIST](https://vclab.kaist.ac.kr/index.html) advised by [Min H. Kim.](https://vclab.kaist.ac.kr/minhkim/index.html)

My research journey in Computer Vision has evolved from exploring structured visual representations (SVG, Layouts) to diving deep into 3D Computer Vision. Currently, I'm focused on **Computational Imaging**, including Computer Graphics, AR/VR, and camera systems. Throughout this journey, I've maintained a strong interest in generative AI.
